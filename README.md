# Adapting Resume to Job Description
This project helps tailor a resume to a specific job description using the GPT API.

## Steps:
* Convert Resume to Markdown: Use a tool like GPT to convert your resume to Markdown format and save it in a text file.
* Job Description: Copy the job description into a separate text file.
* Run the Notebook: The code adapts your resume to the job description, providing both HTML and PDF versions of the adapted resume.

## Notes:
Experiment with the prompt for better results.
GPT-3.5-turbo can produce hallucinations, so using GPT-4 is recommended.
Be aware that the GPT API may add additional context (e.g., introductory/explanatory sentences) at the top or bottom of the generated resume. Feel free to edit these as needed.
